                            <p>We understand that with the latest Government rules and FA guidance, Inner City Club Football will look at restarting training sessions within the necessary rules and guidelines.</p>
                            <p>We also understand the importance of ensuring sessions are safe, not just from a COVID-19 perspective, but also to ensure safeguarding, welfare and other necessary protections continue to be in place. Therefore, we have made provisions to allow some training sessions to happen so long as the following items are met and adhered to at all times:</p>
                            <p>The FA rules and guidelines (can be accessed/viewed by <a href="docs/detailed-covid-19-guidance-on-re-starting-competitive-grassroots-football.pdf" target="_blank">clicking here)</a></p>
                            <p>Information regarding what to expect from The Club and other participants (can be accessed/viewed by <a href="docs/Inner-City-Club-Football-COVID-19-Rules-Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">clicking here)</a></p>
                            <p>We have checked with our insurance provider who have confirmed that the club liability and personal accident insurance is valid so long as activities conform to the FA & government requirements at all times.</p>
                            <p>If at any point The Club feel that training sessions are not being carried out in strict accordance with the required rules then we will stop sessions.</p>
                            <p>Club training sessions & team matches will include close contact between participants during sessions, however social distancing will be carried out before and after in accordance to FA guidance.</p>
                            <p>No club member is obliged to participate in a training session / match if they do not feel that it is right for them due to personal circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Parents or guardians who feel they do not want their child to take part in club activities under the proposed guidelines must make the club’s Welfare Officer aware as soon as possible via <a href="mailto:iccf.cwo@gmail.com">email.</a></p>
