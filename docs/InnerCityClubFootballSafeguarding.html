                                    <li>all children and young people have a right to be protected from abuse

                                    people and their parents/carers is essential.</li>
                                    <li>We acknowledge that every child or young person who plays or participates
                                    in football should be able to take part in an enjoyable and safe environment
                                    and be protected from poor practice and abuse. Inner City Club Football
                                    Leicester recognises that this is the responsibility of every adult involved in

                                    that The Football Association's Safeguarding Children Regulations (see The FA
                                    Handbook) applies to everyone in football whether in a paid or voluntary

                                    in eligible roles, with children and young people - such as managers and
                                    coaches are required to hold an in-date FA accepted Enhanced CRC with
                                    Barring List check as part of responsible recruitment practice 1 .
                                    If there are concerns regarding the appropriateness of an individual who is
                                    already involved or who has approached us to become part of Inner City Club
                                    Football Leicester guidance will be sought from The Football Association. It is
                                    noted and accepted that The FA will consider the relevance and significance of
                                    the information obtained via the CRC Process and that all suitability decisions
                                    will be made in accordance with legislation and in the best interests of
                                    children and young people.
                                    It is accepted that The FA aims to prevent people with a history of relevant
                                    and significant offending from having contact with children or young people
                                    and the opportunity to influence policies or practice with children or young
                                    people. This is to prevent direct sexual or physical harm to children and to
                                    minimise the risk of ‘grooming’ within football.</li>
